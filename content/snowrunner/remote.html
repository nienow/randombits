It allows you to load your saved game file, and edit your progress in the game.
The following can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase your money and rank</li>
<li>Make tasks and missions easier by partially completing them. This is especially useful for the redundant logging tasks. For example, you can reduce a task to require only 1 load by marking other loads as complete.</li>
<li>Reveal hidden upgrade locations, and obtain the upgrades if you're really lazy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must accept the task or mission in the game before it shows up here.</li>
<li>Using the editor to fully complete a task or mission will work, but you will not receive rewards for it. It is recommended to complete the last part of the task in the game.</li>
<li>Always make a backup of your saved game file, just in case.</li>
</ul>
