<h2 id="what-are-micro-frontends">What are micro frontends?</h2>
<p>A micro frontend architecture is defined by the presence of multiple, purpose-built apps that are stitched together to look and function like one big app.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-micro-frontends-in-general">Why use micro frontends (in general)?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest reasons to use micro frontends is to allow teams to build and focus on smaller chunks of the application. A team would own their frontend(s), and it would be independently runnable, testable, and deployable.
Each team could choose a technology stack that works for them and their requirements.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-use-micro-frontends">Why did I use micro frontends?</h2>
<p>With myself being the only developer on this project, it normally would not make sense to use this architecture. However, there were a few good reasons to pursue it:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to better understand the architecture, and hopefully improve it.</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to experiment with different frameworks / libraries (part of the site in react, part in svelte, etc).</li>
<li>I wanted separate repos for the different parts of the site, in order to use them for examples in my articles.</li>
</ol>
